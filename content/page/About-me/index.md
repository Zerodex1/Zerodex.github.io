Hello, I’m Zer0dex a chill guy who loves playing with systems and having fun with computers. Honestly, I don’t even remember when I started learning what I know. All I know is, when I discovered this shit, it felt like smoking weed. Anyway, I’ve picked up some skills and I keep learning every day.

In my free time, I enjoy shadowboxing to Russian music. The best things in life for me are eating when I’m starving, sleeping when I’m exhausted, and the last one you’ll discover it when you marry the one you love.

My outlook on life is simple and can be found in the first sentence after my name: live your life the way you want and enjoy your time.
