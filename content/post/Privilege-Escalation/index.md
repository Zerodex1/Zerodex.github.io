# Privilege escalation 

1-What's Privilege escalation?

2-Types of Privilege escalation.

## What's Privilege escalation :

● Privilege escalation is a critical concept in penetration testing and red
teaming.

● It refers to the process of gaining elevated access or additional privileges
in a computer system or network, typically from a lower-level user to a
higher-level user or administrator.

● Privilege escalation involves exploiting vulnerabilities or
misconfigurations to gain access to resources that are typically restricted
to users with higher privileges.

## Types of Privilege escalation :
Privilege escalation can be divided in two types: vertical and horizontal.
● Vertical: the attacker is able to move from a lower privileged user to a
higher privileged user. For example from a low-end user to administrator
or root user.

● Horizontal: the attacker keeps the same set or level of privileges, but
assumes the identity of a different user (he/she does not gain any further
privilege).
